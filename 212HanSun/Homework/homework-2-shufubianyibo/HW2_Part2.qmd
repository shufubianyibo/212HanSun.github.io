# Instructions

**Task:** Open up the New York Times article [A Summer of Strikes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/03/business/economy/strikes-union-sag-uaw.html), and scroll down to the plot titled "Union membership has fallen sharply over the past four decades (Share of the work force in a union, by industry)".

![](http://bcheggeseth.github.io/212_spring_2025/images/challenge-2-goal.png)

Using `ggplot2` and other tools in R, recreate this plot. Note that you will need to create the data underlying the plot yourself. You can create this data in R with `tibble()`. You can also write the data in Excel or Google Sheets and export it as a CSV file.

**Requirements for high passing:**

- Overall
  - Panels for "All workers", "By Sector", and "By Industry" are shown.
  - Arrows showing the change from 1983 to 2022 are shown.
    - Note: be sure that the arrows all point in the correct direction!
  - The actual percentages in 1983 and 2022 are shown as text.
  - X-axis tick marks are at 0, 25, and 50.
  - Plot title says "Union membership has fallen sharply over the past four decades".
  - Plot subtitle says "Share of the work force in a union, by industry".
- Resource reflection
    - At least 1 resource is listed
    - At least 3 sentences about resources and their helpfulness in the task

**Bonus**: Additional possibilites to enhance your vizualization include adjusting the default aesthetics of the arrows, aligning your plots neatly, and adding margins in order to left-align the y-axis text. 

**Submission:** Click the "Render" button in RStudio to knit a self-contained HTML with all images embedded. Commit and push changes to this file as well as the generated HTML. Push your changes to GitHub by midnight on the deadline. Note that your submission is incomplete without a **readable, rendered HTML** in addition to the qmd file in your Github repo.
